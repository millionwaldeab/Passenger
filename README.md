This is an Android Passenger app. This app together with the driver app will facilitate the process of connecting driver with 
passenger and transporting the passenger from point A to point B. This is the passenger app that is based on Google map. It 
displays the driver's with respect to passneger's position in real time. As long as the driver stays on line, they will be 
available to any passenger app. When a passenger launch their app, they will see all available drivers around them. They will 
have the option to choose the type of vehicle depending the number of passengers and disabiity. They also would have the option 
to choose different pick up location, if they choose to do so; they simply slide the map so the pin is pointing to their desired 
location or they can simply enter the location address at the address box. When they start to type the address manually, the app 
will suggest posible places that start with the same letters in the passenger's area. As soon as they make a request, the closest
driver receives the request in a form of alert box in the middle of the screen with an alarm ring tone. The driver will have an 
option either to accept or decline the request. 
If the driver accepts the request, then they will have the option to get navigation to the location of the passenger. At that 
time the passenger will get the real time location of the driver while the driver is navigating towards the pick up location. 
Both of them will have the option to cancel the request until the driver gets to the pick up location. If one of them cancels 
the request, the other will be notified immediately.
